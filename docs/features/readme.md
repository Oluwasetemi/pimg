# Features

---

These are some basic features of pimg:

* [DataSaver](/docs/features/data_saver.md) - Renders a button in the middle of the image, and fetches the image once the button is pressed.
* [ScrollToReveal](//docs/features/scroll_to_reveal.md) - Fetches the image as soon as we scroll to it's position on the page.

Others will be added later.
